“Car Parking Detection and Space Counter Using CNN and OpenCV” is designed to automate the process of detecting and managing parking slots. 
This system is built using Python and OpenCV as the front end TensorFlow for deep learning, and Flask for dashboard integration, running on a Windows11 platform. 
The computerization is aimed at improving efficiency, reducing congestion, and providing real-time parking availability updates. The proposed system processes real-time 
images from surveillance cameras using a fine-tuned VGG16 CNN model. The model identifies individual parking slots and classifies them as occupied or vacant with high accuracy. 
Data augmentation techniques are applied to improve the model's robustness under different lighting and camera angles. The main goal of the project is to streamline the parking process, 
enhance parking slot utilization, and improve vehicle safety and user convenience.
